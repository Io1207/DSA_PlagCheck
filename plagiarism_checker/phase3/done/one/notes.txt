Replace vector, string with std::vector, std::string
If a statement has a multitude of operations like [], +, ==, < and so on, break it into simple operations
Make a whole bunch of temporary variables in the process

Didn't have to use singer-breaker
Didn't check against MOSS, maybe singer-breaker will be needed there
